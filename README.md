# computational-math
A collection of programs I wrote for my computational math and numerical methods courses. Includes implementations of key algorithms for mathematical use cases, such as solving for roots, approximating derivatives, and solving systems of equations.

These programs were originally written during the Fall semester of 2023 and Spring semester of 2024. As these are just the programming sections of sometimes larger assignments, there may be missing context or method names which don't make sense on their own. Additionally, these programs may be incomplete or include errors.

I do not condone cheating, so if you are somebody currently enrolled in a computational math or numerical methods course, do not refer to this repository. I am not responsible for dishonest usage of this repo.
